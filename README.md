# Daily Planner

## Introduction
GRADER: I had to restart my repository because i accidentally cloned the starter code and was working from there. i worked with a tutor to get this solved and we just made a new repo. So that is why i did not have any commits..
This project is a daily planner designed to help users create and manage their schedules efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface with features such as displaying the current day, time blocks for standard business hours, color-coding for past, present, and future time blocks, event entry, and local storage for saving events.

## Features

1. **Current Day Display:**
   - Upon opening the planner, the current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar.

2. **Time Blocks:**
   - As you scroll down, time blocks for standard business hours (9 am to 5 pm) are presented, allowing you to organize your schedule throughout the day.

3. **Color-Coded Time Blocks:**
   - Time blocks are color-coded to visually indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future, providing a quick overview of your schedule.

4. **Event Entry:**
   - Click into a time block to enter and save events for that specific time.

5. **Save to Local Storage:**
   - After entering an event, clicking the save button for the corresponding time block saves the event text to local storage.

6. **Persistent Saved Events:**
   - Even after refreshing the page, saved events persist, ensuring that your schedule remains intact.
